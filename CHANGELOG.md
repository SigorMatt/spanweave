# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. Entries are written when the change lands, not
at release time.

This file starts at the September 2026 audit-fix series. The `0.9.0` and
`0.9.1` releases predate it and are **not** reconstructed here: an invented
history is worse than an absent one, and their content is in git.

The format is loosely [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the
project follows semantic versioning with the caveat that the serialized graph
shape is **unfrozen until Phase 4** (`ROADMAP.md`).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Reading a record, or parsing a payload, nested deeper than the JSON parser
  will recurse no longer raises `RecursionError` out of the library. `json`
  reports that depth as a `RecursionError` rather than a `ValueError`, so it
  escaped the guards in the reader and in both adapters and took the whole
  build down. Such a record is now a `malformed_record` diagnostic carrying
  its text and the read continues; such a payload is `payload_parse_failed`
  with the text kept verbatim, as `SPEC.md` §7 now states. (audit finding 3)
